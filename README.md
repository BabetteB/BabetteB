<h1 align="center">Hi, I’m Babette 👋</h1>

- I’m studying to become a system architect; Currently I mostly build with .NET/C# + Angular and pipeline + configuring code analysis tools 
- Recurring Teaching Assistant in mobile app dev. I care about extensive feedback, and that the students learn to argue about what they are doing

### What I’m working on 🛠️

- **ArchLens** — static analysis for multi-level dependency graphs

### What I love to nerd with 🔍

- Reproducibility (Docker, scripts over docs)  
- CI/CD & IaC
- Quality by default (clean code, tests, static analysis tools)  
- Architecture (visualising architecture for multiple audiences, making architecture dynamic docs)

### Interests 🧵

- Clean code & maintainability  
- Making the maintainable way the **easy** way  
- Infrastructure as Code  
- Visualizing workflows
- Dynamic docs & automation

## Tech Stack 🧰

> I pick up new tools quickly—if a language or platform fits the job, I’ll learn it.

### Languages & Frameworks
`C#` · `.NET / ASP.NET` · `TypeScript` · `Angular` · `Go` · `Python` · `Java` · `Kotlin` · `HTML/CSS` · `SQL` · `PowerShell` · `Bash` · `PlantUML (PUML)` · `XML` · `XAML` · `YML`

## Philosophy 🪐

- Architects should program more
- The most important and under-appreciated quality requirement is maintainability
- Stay true to your expertise — remember that you’re the tech-xpert. Don’t cut corners on quality
- Ship work you’re proud of & write clean code
- “I’ll fix it later” will come back to haunt you
- Find the perfect balance of not marrying a tool, while don't blindly following hypes - stay curious and choose tools that solve your problems
