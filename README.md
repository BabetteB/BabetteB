  <b>MSc Computer Science @ IT University of Copenhagen</b> • Software Architecture • DevOps & CI/CD • Security & Risk

## About me 🧭

- I’m studying to become a system architect; I like to know that there is a sound foundation before developing 
- Right now I mostly build with .NET/C# + Angular; If I get to play around I will quickly start to implement code quality, reproducibility and automation mechanisms.
- I am risk and security aware and curious
- Recurring Teaching Assistant in mobile app dev. I care about extensive feedback, and that the students learn to argue about what they are doing

### What I’m working on 🛠️

- **ArchLens** — static analysis for multi-level dependency graphs

### What I love to nerd with 🔍

- Reproducibility: Dev Containers / Docker Compose, scripts over docs  
- CI/CD & IaC: fast PR pipelines, sane cache keys, infra you can version and review  
- Quality by default: clean code, tests, static analysis  
- Architecture: diagraming, trade-off analysis, arguing patterns

### Interests 🧵

- Clean code & maintainability  
- Making the maintainable way the **easy** way  
- Infrastructure as Code  
- Visualizing workflows

## Tech Stack 🧰

> I pick up new tools quickly—if a language or platform fits the job, I’ll learn it.

### Languages & Frameworks 💬
`C#` · `.NET / ASP.NET` · `TypeScript` · `Angular` · `Go` · `Python` · `Java` · `Kotlin` · `HTML/CSS` · `SQL` · `PowerShell` · `Bash` · `PlantUML (PUML)` · `XML` · `XAML` · `YML`

### Cloud, Infra & Containers 🌥️
`Docker` · `Docker Compose` · `Dev Containers` · `Azure DevOps` (Repos, Pipelines, Artifacts) · `Digital Ocean`

### CI/CD & Quality 🔁
`Azure Pipelines` · `SonarCloud` · `GitHub Actions`

## Philosophy 🪐

- The most important and under-appreciated quality requirement is maintainability
- Architects should program more
- Stay true to your expertise — remember that you’re the tech-xpert. Don’t cut corners on quality
- Ship work you’re proud of
- Write clean code
- “I’ll fix it later” will come back to haunt you
- Don’t marry a tool - stay curious
- Everything is a trade-off
- Don’t follow hype; choose tools that solve your problems
